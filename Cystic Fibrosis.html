<p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that usually affects multiple organ systems of the body, particularly the lungs and pancreas. It is known for affecting certain glands of the body such as  those that produce mucus, saliva, or sweat. When these glands are affected, their secretions become much thicker and can potentially clog up vital sections of the body. This is dangerous because it can lead to inflammation, obstruction, or infection. </p>

<h1>What are its Symptoms? </h1>
<p>The symptoms of cystic fibrosis can vary greatly in number and severity from one individual to another. With that being said, common symptoms include breathing problems, shortness of breath, lung infections, obstruction of the pancreas, and obstruction of the intestines. Affected individuals will often secrete mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky, whereas normal mucus should be thin and slippery. Saliva, sweat, and digestive juices may also be affected. The production of thick, sticky mucus can block air passages in the body, thus creating breathing problems. However, since mucus is stuck in the airways, bacteria can also be trapped and accumulated, making people with this disease prone to chronic respiratory infections. </p>
<p>Since cystic fibrosis can obstruct the pancreas through mucus buildup in the pancreatic ducts, it can block enzymes that are needed to break down and absorb food and nutrients. The lack of nutrients may hinder a childâ€™s ability to grow and gain weight at an expected rate. The obstruction of the intestines may cause stomach aches, bloating, cramping, nausea, and loss of appetite. </p>
<h1>What is its Cause? </h1>
<p>Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The CFTR gene provides instructions for the CFTR protein. Normally, CFTR proteins allow cells to release chloride and other ions. However, for people with cystic fibrosis, this protein becomes defective, and the cells do not release the chloride. The inability for the cells to release chloride leads to an improper salt balance in the cells, which is how mucus becomes thick and sticky. </p>
<h1>Treatment  </h1>
<p> While there is no known cure for cystic fibrosis, there are several types of treatment available. Chest physical therapy can help dislodge mucus from the lungs and keep airways unobstructed. Some physical therapy requires assistance from others while others are able to be performed without aid(for adults with cystic fibrosis that is.) Antibiotics may also be used to treat and/or reduce lung infections. Antibiotic drugs that may be administered are tobramycin, aztreonam, dornase alfa, and ivacaftor. Patients with cystic fibrosis that have gastrointestinal problems may need to take an enriched diet or take replacement vitamins that are absorbed when mixed with fatty foods. Enzyme replacement therapy and diet can help treat pancreatic insufficiency. In severe cases of cystic fibrosis, however, a lung transplant may be necessary.  </p>
