         <h1>What is it? </h1>
         <p>Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus spreads from person to person and can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). </p>

         <h1>What are its symptoms?</h1>
         <p>Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. </p>

         <h1>How can it be transmitted? </h1>
         <p>Poliovirus is very contagious and spreads through person-to-person contact. It lives in an infected person’s throat and intestines. Poliovirus only infects people. It enters the body through the mouth and spreads through: Contact with the feces (poop) of an infected person. Droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person (less common). You can get infected with poliovirus if: You have feces on your hands, and you touch your mouth. You put in your mouth objects like toys that are contaminated with feces. </p>
         <h1>Other facts about the disease</h1>
         <p>Unfortunately, once people are infected, there is no cure for the disease. However, In 1988, the Forty-first World Health Assembly adopted a resolution for the worldwide eradication of polio. It marked the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), spearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), etc. Overall since the GPEI was launched, the number of cases has fallen by over 99%.  More than 18 million people are able to walk today, who would otherwise have been paralysed. An estimated 1.5 million childhood deaths have been prevented, through the systematic administration of vitamin A during polio immunization activities. </p>
