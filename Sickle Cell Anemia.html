<p>Sickle-Cell Anemia is a rare blood disease that produces sickle-shaped red blood cells, which do not last as long as typical red blood cells. Thus, it can lead to anemia, a condition marked by a low amount of red blood cells. What makes this more problematic is that they can get stuck in blood vessels and block blood flow. Sickle-shaped cells are also deficient in hemoglobin, which is an iron-rich protein contained in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. </p>
<p>Sickle-cell anemia is not the only type of sickle cell disease, though it is the most common and severe form. Some forms, like sickle beta-zero thalassemia are just as severe. However, sickle beta-plus thalassemia and sickle cell hemoglobin C disease are usually less severe.  </p>

<h1>What are its causes? </h1>
<p> Sickle-Cell Anemia is a disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. If a person has one normal and one gene for the disease, then that person will be a carrier of the disease while typically not showing symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will have that condition, 50% chance for the child to be a carrier like the parents, and 25% chance of neither being a carrier nor having the condition. </p>
<p>However, infected people can have a different mutation from their parents. This can lead to forms of this disease such as sickle beta-thalassemia and sickle cell hemoglobin C disease. </p>
<h1>What are its symptoms? </h1>
<p> While sickle-cell anemia is technically present at birth since it is a genetic disease, most infants do not have any visible symptoms until four months or several years of age. These signs normally begin in the first three years of life. As people with this disease grow older, additional complications become more common. </p>
<p>One sign of this disease is fatigue. Another symptom are episodes of pain that can occur suddenly and normally take place in bones and the abdomen, and these moments of pain can either be acute or chronic. Sickle-cell anemia can also cause jaundice, which turns the eyes and skin yellow. For infants, signs may manifest through swollen and painful hands and/or feet, irritability, crying, and severe infections. </p>
<p>As people with SCD age, other additional complications become more common. Damage to the small blood vessels and air sacs in the lungs can result in pulmonary(relating to the lungs) hypertension, which can cause decreased ability to exercise, shortness of breath and tiredness. Leg sores that are often hard to heal , damage to the retina can, and kidney damage can also occur. </p>
<p> Infected patients may also have an enlarged spleen because it traps red blood cells that should be in the bloodstream. This is problematic because the function of the spleen is to filter out abnormal red blood cells and fight some infections such as the bacteria that cause strep throat. Thus, a damaged spleen can result in a weakened ability to fight some typically mild infections, making those infections potentially life-threatening. </p>
<p>If infection or sickled cells from the disease damages the lungs, then acute chest syndrome can occur. Sometimes people can’t tell they have it but other times people can have chest pain, difficulty breathing or fever. Additional complications include stroke, which can occur in children as young as 2 years.  </p>
<h1>What can I do about it? </h1>
<p>The following can help prevent severe complications from developing and improve the patient’s quality of life: patient and family education, medicines like hydroxycarbamide, avoiding triggers, and early intervention. </p>
<p>Although very few people with this disease are able to be cured, early notification of newborns to specialty centers can provide education and resources that can help control symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. In addition, many simple lifestyle activities can be done to support health and minimize pain and other complications. These include remaining hydrated, not getting too hot or cold, getting exercise, deep breathing, not getting fatigued and avoiding trauma. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families. </p>
<p> Blood transfusions can be used for many reasons such as very severe anemia, preparing for surgery, reducing the risk of stroke. Stem cell transplant can provide a cure for patients but the chance of success and potential risks vary depending on many factors.</p>
