        <h1>What is Cat Scratch Disease? </h1>
        <p>Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria known as Bartonella henselae. As the name suggests, it is transmitted by cats, usually by scratches or bites. Cats can become infected with the bacteria through fleas or fights from infected cats. While some get sick from the bacteria, others simply carry it. </p>

        <h1>What are its Symptoms? </h1>
        <p>From 3 to 14 days, a mild infection will form at the area bitten or scratched by a cat. Lymph nodes will also swell, and the afflicted person may also experience fever, headache, fatigue, achiness, and a poor appetite. Lymphadenopathy(disease of the lymph nodes), normally fades within a few months, though this may also take a few years for it to disappear. </p>

        <h1>Should I Be Worried About it? </h1>
        <p> Fortunately, Cat Scratch Disease is a mild disease. The disease normally passes by without requiring medical treatment, though pain relievers and antibiotics can help treat it. However, this does not mean the disease is not harmless. People with weakened immune systems or young children may face a more severe case of cat scratch disease. Nonetheless, this disease can simply be avoided by giving a cat a flea collar, playing gently with cats to avoid the chances of getting scratched, or simply avoid contact with a cat. </p>
