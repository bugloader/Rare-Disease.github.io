        <h1>What is rabies? </h1>
        <p>Rabies is a virus often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal, an animal that has the rabies virus. It infects the central nervous system of mammals, thereby spreading disease to the brain and resulting in death. The CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reports that rabies is found but not limited to wild mammals like foxes, raccoons, bats, and skunks (though any mammal can catch rabies.) </p>

        <h1>How is it transmitted? </h1>
        <p>Rabies is often transmitted through bites from a rabid animal. However, it is possible that a rabid animal’s saliva can transmit the disease by making contact with scratches, abrasions, or open wounds. </p>

        <h1>Symptoms  </h1>
        <p>After exposure to rabies is an incubation period, ranging from a week to a year. This incubation period depends upon the location of the virus entry, the type of rabies virus, any existing immunity, and viral load. Also, there may be discomfort or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. After that, symptoms begin to develop, and the first of which may be similar to those of the flu such as fever or headache. However, symptoms will gradually worsen as the victim may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, insomnia, and even hydrophobia (the fear of water.) </p>

        <h1>What happens if I get rabies? </h1>
        <p>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate treatment for bite victims after exposure, and it prevents virus entry into the central nervous system. It consists of extensive washing and local treatment of the wound ASAP after exposure, a potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO standards, and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) if indicated. There are 3 categories of contact and recommended PEP procedures. The first one requires no PEP measures if the animal licks on intact skin or if you are feeding or touching animals. The second one, however, requires immediate vaccination and local treatment of the wounds if there is nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches, or abrasions. The third one requires immediate vaccination and administration of RIG if the exposure is severe enough. </p>
        <h1>Is rabies treatable? </h1>
        <p> Fortunately, this virus can easily be avoided. If you have pets, you can visit your local veterinarian to administer a rabies vaccine. Rabies can also be avoided if you simply leave wildlife alone.</p>
        <h1>Trivia</h1>
        <p>Etymology: originates from the Latin word “rabies,” which means “madness.” Rabies is present on all continents except for Antarctica, with 95% of human deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. Very few people have ever survived rabies. In fact, according to the CDC, less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been recorded. </p>
