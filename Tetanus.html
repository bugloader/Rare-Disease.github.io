         <h1>What is it?</h1>
         <p>Tetanus is a serious disease caused by a bacterial toxin that affects your nervous system, leading to painful muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus can interfere with your ability to breathe and can threaten your life. Tetanus is commonly known as "lockjaw."</p>
         <img src="img\tetanus.png" width=70%>
         <h1>What caused it?</h1>
         <p>Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of bacteria, Clostridium tetani, found in soil, dust and animal feces. When the spores enter a deep flesh wound, they grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons). The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms â€” the major signs and symptoms of tetanus.  </p>
         <h1>Risks for getting tetanus</h1>
         <img src="img\tetanus2.png" width=70%>
         <p>The following increase your likelihood of getting tetanus: Failure to get vaccinated or to keep up to date with booster shots against tetanus. An injury that lets tetanus spores into the wound. A foreign body, such as a nail or splinter. Tetanus can also develop from the following cases: Puncture wounds(including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos and injection drugs), gunshot wounds, compound fractures, burns, surgical wounds, injection drug use, animal or insect bites, infected foot ulcers, and dental infections </p>
         <h1>How do we prevent it?</h1>
         <p>People can simply prevent getting tetanus by being vaccinated. The tetanus vaccine usually is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. This vaccination provides protection against three diseases: a throat and respiratory infection (diphtheria), whooping cough (pertussis) and tetanus. </p>
