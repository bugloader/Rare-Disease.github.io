<p>ALS, also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig’s disease, mainly affects the neurons that enable voluntary muscle movement. Currently, there is no known cure or effective treatment to slow down or reverse the disease’s progression. </p>

<h1>What does it mean? </h1>
<p> Let’s break down what Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis means. First is the word “amyotrophic”, in which comes from several Greek terms. “A-” means no, “myo” means muscle, and “trophic” means nourishment. Thus, amyotrophic literally means “no muscle nourishment.” Next is the word “lateral.” “Lateral” refers to the regions of the human’s spinal cord. In these regions, there are nerve cells that can signal and control muscles. Let’s move on to the last word “sclerosis.” This word is also of Greek origin, meaning “harden.” So in other words, the literal meaning of “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” is the lack of muscle nourishment and hardening of the lateral spinal cord.</p>
<h1>What are its symptoms? What are its causes? </h1>
<p>According to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) Fact Sheet, published by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, symptoms include: muscle twitches in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue, muscle cramps, tight and stiff muscles, difficulty chewing or swallowing, slurred and nasal speech, and muscle weakness affecting an arm, diaphragm, a leg, or neck. </p>
<p>The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) Fact Sheet also reports that many may notice the first sign of ALS appearing in the hand or arm; in other cases, it can also initially manifest in one of the legs. When symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as “limb onset” ALS. Other times, it can also manifest first through speech swallowing problems, which is known as“bulbar onset” ALS. </p>
<p> Although the progression of the disease varies from person to person, individuals affected will eventually be unable to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or even use their hands and arms. In addition, because ALS affects the ability to swallow and chew, people with ALS have the risk of choking. Furthermore, what makes ALS lethal is that it can cause difficulty in breathing as it weakens the respiratory system. </p>
<p>As for causes of this disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) Fact Sheet reports that while the causes are not be exactly known, it is likely that genetic and environmental plays a role in this. The website reports that more than a dozen genetic mutations have been identified and each provides “new insights into possible mechanisms of ALS.” For instance, the discovery of certain genetic mutations suggests that changes in how RNA molecules, which are one of the major macromolecules in the cell responsible for controlling the creation of certain proteins and gene regulation and activity, are processed may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration. Although there has yet to be a consistent link between environmental factors and ALS, “researchers have suggested that exposure to toxins during warfare, or strenuous physical activity, are possible reasons for why some veterans and athletes may be at increased risk of developing ALS.” </p>
<h1>Are there ways to detect ALS? Is there any treatment? </h1>
<p> Unfortunately, as of today, there is no cure for ALS and no treatment known to effectively stunt or reverse the growth of the disease. However, treatments are available to help control symptoms, prevent unnecessary complications, and help cope with the disease. This ranges from supportive care, physical therapy, medication like riluzole(Rilutek) and edaravone(Radicava), speech therapy, nutritional support, and breathing support.</p>
<h1>Trivia </h1>
<p> Lou Gehrig was a New York Yankees baseball player who was forced to retire in 1939 after contracting the disease, hence why ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. In 2014, a trend of internet videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge appeared, intending to raise public awareness of the disease.</p>
