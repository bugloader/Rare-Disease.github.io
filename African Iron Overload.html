         <h1>What is it?</h1>
         <p>African iron overload is a condition that involves the absorption of too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the liver, bone marrow, and spleen. Humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, although some iron is lost through bleeding or when cells of the intestine (enterocytes) are shed at the end of the cells' lifespan.</p>
         <h1>What caused it? </h1>
         <p>African iron overload was first noted in rural central and southern African populations among people who drink a traditional beer brewed in uncoated steel drums that allow iron (a component of steel) to leach into the beer. However, not all individuals who drink the beer develop African iron overload, and not all individuals of African descent with iron overload drink the beer. Therefore, researchers are seeking genetic differences that affect the risk of developing this condition.</p>
         <h1>Does it have an inheritance pattern?</h1>
         <p>Yes, it does. Scientists have found that African iron overload seems to run in families, and high iron in a family's diet seems to be the major contributor to the development of the condition. There also may be a genetic contribution, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. People with a specific variation in the SLC40A1 gene may inherit an increased risk of this condition, but not the condition itself. Not all people with this condition have a variation in the gene, and not all people with the variation will develop the disorder.</p>
