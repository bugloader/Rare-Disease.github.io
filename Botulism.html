<p>Botulism is a paralytic disease that is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. There are several types of botulism. These are foodborne, wound, infant, and adult intestinal colonization botulism. The disease attacks the body’s nerves, thereby causing weakness of the muscles that control the eyes, face, mouth, and throat. However, it can also affect muscles involved in breathing, making it much more deadly. </p>

<h1>What are its symptoms? </h1>
<p>For foodborne botulism, the incubation period typically lasts between 12-36 hours., though this can last up to 10 days. Symptoms include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, a thick-feeling tongue, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. However, infants with botulism may appear lethargic, feed poorly, be constipated, have a weak cry, and appear floppy from poor muscle tone. Infant botulism normally affects infants under 12 months of age. The progression of botulism is similar among patients with different types of botulism, but patients with foodborne botulism may face gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. </p>

<h1>What are its causes? </h1>
<p> Wound botulism occurs when the C. botulinum spores germinate and produce toxin in a wound. The chances of contracting wound botulism increases should people inject certain drugs such as black tar heroin. Foodborne botulism happens when ingesting foods that contain the botulinum toxin. However, infant botulism results from the ingestion of bacterial spores that grow and produce botulinum toxin within the large intestine. The C. botulinum bacterium can be found in soils and marine sediments throughout the world. People may be at risk of contracting foodborne botulism from consuming home-canned vegetables, meats, and traditional Alaska Native foods such as fermented fish. Consuming certain alcohols such as “pruno” or “hooch” may also increase the risks of getting foodborne botulism. </p>
<h1>What can I do about it? </h1>
<p>There are a variety of ways to avoid botulism. To avoid contracting foodborne botulism, home-canned and commercially-canned foods should be prepared and stored properly, and foods that have signs of spoilage should be discarded. Fortunately, C. botulinum spores can be destroyed should they be exposed to a heat of 120 degrees Celsius, and heating food at 85 degrees Celsius or boiling point can deactivate the toxin. Wound botulism can be avoided by simply keeping wounds clean and by avoiding certain illicit drugs such as black tar heroin. For infant botulism, infants less than 12 months of age should not be given honey. </p>
<p> As for treatment, botulism can be treated with a drug called an antitoxin. Though the antitoxin does not heal the damage already dealt by the toxin, it can prevent further harm. Depending on how severe symptoms become, the duration of staying in the hospital can range from weeks to even months. If symptoms result in breathing problems or breathing failure, you may be put on a breathing machine until you can breathe on your own again. If you have wound botulism, you may need surgery to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria and be administered antibiotics. </p>
