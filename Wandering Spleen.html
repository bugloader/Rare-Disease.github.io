         <h1>What is it?</h1>
         <p>Wandering spleen is a rare medical disease caused by the loss or weakening of the ligaments that help to hold the spleen stationary. Wandering spleen is also called displaced spleen, drifting spleen, Solenopsis, floating spleen, or splenic ptosis.</p>
         <img src="img/spleen1.png" width=70%>
         <h1>What caused it? </h1>
         <p>Wandering spleen can be either congenital, which means a person is born with this condition, or acquired, which means it occurred during adulthood due to injuries of other underlying conditions that may weaken the ligaments that hold the spleen.</p>
         <h1>What are the symptoms of it?</h1>
         <p>Symptoms of wandering spleen may include enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly), abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, nausea, vomiting, fever, and a lump in the abdomen or the pelvis. Some individuals with this condition do not have symptoms.</p>

         <h1>What are the treatments?</h1>
         <p>Since wandering spleen can cause fatal complications, it is highly recommended to remove the spleen through surgeries. Laparoscopic splenectomy is the typical method used for spleen removal.</p>
