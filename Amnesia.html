        <h1>What is Amnesia? </h1>

        <h1>What happens if I get rabies? </h1>
        <p>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate treatment for bite victims after exposure, and it prevents virus entry into the central nervous system. It consists of extensive washing and local treatment of the wound ASAP after exposure, a potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO standards, and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) if indicated. There are 3 categories of contact and recommended PEP procedures. The first one requires no PEP measures if the animal licks on intact skin or if you are feeding or touching animals. The second one, however, requires immediate vaccination and local treatment of the wounds if there is nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches, or abrasions. The third one requires immediate vaccination and administration of RIG if the exposure is severe enough. </p>
        <h1>Do I need to see a doctor? </h1>
        <p>If you have experience difficulty that you have trouble on memory, and you recently got a head injury or lost conscious, you should see the doctor immidiately.</p>
